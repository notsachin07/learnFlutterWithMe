# Class 05: Inheritance & Polymorphism 🧬

**Builds on:** Class 04 (Classes & Constructors), all previous classes

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

After completing this class, you will understand:

- **Inheritance** — Creating classes that inherit from parent classes
- **The `extends` keyword** — How to establish parent-child relationships
- **Method overriding** — Customizing inherited methods in child classes
- **Polymorphism** — Using parent class references for child objects
- **The `super` keyword** — Accessing parent class methods and constructors
- **Polymorphic collections** — Lists of parent type containing child objects
- **Real-world inheritance hierarchies** — Animal → Dog, Vehicle → Car patterns

## 🧠 Prerequisites

You should be comfortable with:
- ✅ Class definition and properties (Class 04)
- ✅ Constructors and initialization (Class 04)
- ✅ Methods and how objects work (Class 04)
- ✅ Named parameters (Class 03)
- ✅ Collections and loops (Class 02)

## 📖 Why Learn Inheritance?

Inheritance is **one of the pillars of Object-Oriented Programming**. Instead of duplicating similar code, you create:
- **Parent classes** with common functionality
- **Child classes** that inherit and specialize

**Real-world analogy:** All smartphones have batteries, screens, and can make calls. But an iPhone also has Face ID, and a Samsung has an always-on display. Instead of coding all this twice, Samsung and iPhone inherit from "Smartphone" and add their unique features.

## 🔄 Progression in This Class

### Part 1: Basic Inheritance
- Understanding parent-child relationships
- Using `extends` keyword
- Inherited properties and methods

### Part 2: Method Overriding
- Customizing inherited methods in child classes
- Using `@override` annotation
- Polymorphic behavior

### Part 3: The `super` Keyword
- Calling parent class constructors
- Accessing parent class methods
- Proper initialization chains

### Part 4: Polymorphism & Collections
- Treating child objects as parent type
- Creating lists of parent type with mixed children
- Real-world polymorphic patterns

## 📁 How to Use This Class

1. **Read README.md** (this file) — Understand learning goals
2. **Study 01_inheritance_basics.md** — Learn fundamental concepts
3. **Study 02_polymorphism.md** — Master advanced patterns
4. **Run main.dart** — See working examples: `dart main.dart`
5. **Solve exercises.md** — Practice what you've learned
6. **Compare solutions/** — Review reference implementations

## 🎓 Real-World Connection

Inheritance appears **everywhere**:
- **Flutter widgets:** `StatelessWidget`, `StatefulWidget`, `MaterialApp` all inherit from base Widget classes
- **Android/iOS:** All Activities/ViewControllers inherit from base classes
- **Web browsers:** All DOM elements inherit from `Element`
- **Game development:** All game objects inherit from `GameObject`

## ⏱️ Estimated Time

- **Reading lessons:** 30-45 minutes
- **Running examples:** 10 minutes
- **Solving exercises:** 45-60 minutes
- **Total:** ~1.5-2 hours

## 🚀 What's Next After Class 05?

After mastering inheritance, you'll be ready for:
- **Interfaces and abstract classes** (advanced OOP)
- **Mixins** (Dart-specific multiple inheritance pattern)
- **Generic types** (creating flexible, reusable code)
- **Flutter development** (inheriting from Flutter widget classes)
