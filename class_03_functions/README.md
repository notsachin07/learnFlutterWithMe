# Class 03: Functions & Parameters

Functions are the building blocks of any application. In Flutter, you will use functions for everything: from building UI widgets to handling button clicks.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Define and call functions.
- Understand Return Types (`void`, `int`, `String`, etc.).
- Master **Arrow Syntax** (`=>`) for cleaner code.
- **CRITICAL:** Understand **Named Parameters** (`{}`). This is how 90% of Flutter code is written.

## 🧠 Python Comparison
- **Def:** In Python, you use `def my_func():`. In Dart, you specify the return type: `void myFunc()`.
- **Arrow:** Python has `lambda`. Dart has `=>`, but Dart's arrow functions are much more commonly used for standard class methods.
