# Class 02: Control Flow

In Class 01, our code ran from top to bottom, line by line. In Class 02, we learn how to control *execution order*.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Master Conditional Logic (`if`, `else if`, `else`).
- Learn the `switch` statement for cleaner multi-choice logic.
- Master Loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`).
- Understand `break` and `continue`.

## 🧠 Python vs. Dart Note
If you are coming from Python:
1. **Indentation doesn't matter** for logic (only for readability).
2. You **must** use curly braces `{ }` to define blocks.
3. Python's `elif` is written as `else if`.
