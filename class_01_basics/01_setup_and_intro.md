# Lesson 1.1: Setup and Hello World

## The Entry Point
Every Dart (and Flutter) application starts in one specific place: the `main()` function. If you are coming from C++ or Java, this will look familiar. If you are coming from Python, this is similar to the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block, but mandatory.

### The Structure
```dart
void main() {
  // This is a comment
  print("Hello, Flutter Developer!"); 
}
