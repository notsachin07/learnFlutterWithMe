# Class 01 Exercises

Test your understanding of the basics. Create a file named `solution_01.dart` and solve these.

## Exercise 1: The Bio
Write a Dart program that stores the following data in variables with the **correct types**:
* Your Name
* Your Age
* Your Height (in cm)
* Whether you like coding (boolean)

Then, print them out in a single sentence using **String Interpolation**.

*Example Output:*
`"My name is Alex, I am 20 years old, 180.5cm tall, and it is true that I like coding."`

## Exercise 2: The Swapper
1. Create two integer variables, `a = 10` and `b = 20`.
2. Write code to swap their values so that `a` becomes 20 and `b` becomes 10.
3. Print the results.

## Exercise 3: Type Correction
Identify what is wrong with this code snippet and fix it:
```dart
void main() {
  var message = "Hello";
  message = 123; 
  print(message);
}
