# Class 01: The Foundation & Dart Basics

Welcome to the first step of the **learnFlutterWithMe** journey! Before we build mobile apps with Flutter, we must understand the language that powers them: **Dart**.

Dart is a modern, object-oriented programming language created by Google. It's designed to be fast, productive, and scalable. If you've programmed in Python, JavaScript, Java, or C++, you'll find Dart familiar. But don't worry if you haven't—we'll start from the very beginning!

## 📚 What You'll Learn

In this class, you'll learn the foundational concepts of Dart programming:

### 1. **Setting Up & Your First Program**
   - How to set up Flutter/Dart on your computer
   - Understanding what the `main()` function is (the starting point of every program)
   - Writing your first program that prints "Hello World"
   - Running Dart programs from the command line

### 2. **Variables and Data Types**
   - What are variables? (containers that store information)
   - Different data types: numbers (`int`, `double`), text (`String`), and true/false (`bool`)
   - How to declare variables (tell Dart what you want to store)
   - Type inference: letting Dart figure out the type automatically
   - String interpolation: combining text and variables

## 🏃 Learning Objectives
- ✅ Set up Flutter/Dart SDK correctly
- ✅ Understand and use the `main()` function
- ✅ Learn output with `print()` statements
- ✅ Master Variables and Data Types (`int`, `String`, `bool`, `double`)
- ✅ Understand Type Inference (`var`) vs Static Typing
- ✅ Use String Interpolation to combine text and variables
- ✅ Write simple programs that solve real problems

## 🛠 Prerequisites

Before starting, you should have:
- **Flutter SDK installed** on your computer (includes Dart)
- **A code editor** like VS Code, Android Studio, or any text editor you prefer
- **A terminal/command prompt** to run Dart programs
- **Basic computer skills** (ability to open files, use a terminal)
- **Enthusiasm to learn!** 💪

## 📖 How to Use This Class

1. **Read the lessons** in order (01_setup_and_intro.md, then 02_variables_and_types.md)
2. **Type out the code** examples yourself (don't just copy-paste!)
3. **Run the programs** to see what happens
4. **Try the exercises** at the end
5. **Check the solutions** only after you try
