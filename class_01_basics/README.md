# Class 01: The Foundation & Dart Basics

Welcome to the first step of the **learnFlutterWithMe** journey! Before we build mobile apps, we must understand the language that powers them: **Dart**.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Set up the Flutter/Dart SDK.
- Understand the `main()` function.
- Learn basic output (`print`).
- Master Variables and Data Types (`int`, `String`, `bool`, `double`).
- Understand Type Inference (`var`) vs Static Typing.

## 🛠 Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK installed.
- VS Code or Android Studio (or Neovim/Emacs if you are comfortable with CLI).
