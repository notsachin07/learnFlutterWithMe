# Class 04: OOP - Classes & Objects

Welcome to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). If you know Python, you know classes (`class MyClass:`). Dart is similar but more structured.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Define a Class (Blueprint) and create Objects (Instances).
- Understand Properties (Variables) and Methods (Functions).
- **CRITICAL:** Master **Constructors** (Standard vs. Named).
- Understand why Flutter code is just a tree of Dart Classes.

## 🧠 Python vs. Dart
- **Self:** In Python, you write `self.variable`. In Dart, you use `this.variable` (or just `variable` if there's no ambiguity).
- **Init:** Python uses `def __init__`. Dart uses a function with the **same name** as the class.
- **New:** In older languages (Java/C++), you use `new ClassName()`. In Dart, `new` is optional and usually skipped.
